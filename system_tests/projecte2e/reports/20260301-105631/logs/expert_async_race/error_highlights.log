128:3. **`fail()` - Missing counter decrement**: Added `state.running -= 1` to properly track running tasks. Previously only incremented `failed`.
130:4. **`snapshot()` - Split-lock inconsistency**: Combined all three counter reads into a single lock acquisition. Previously read `running` under one lock, then `completed` and `failed` under another, allowing inconsistent views where the sum could exceed expected values.
