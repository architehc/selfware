94:The issue is that the test expects `seq=7` (with equals sign) but my output shows `seq: 7` (with colon and space). Looking at the test error message more carefully, it says "Display should contain seq: Event { topic: \"user.login\", seq: 7 }" - this means the test is checking if the display output contains `seq=7`, but my current output `Event { topic: "user.login", seq: 7 }` contains `seq: 7` not `seq=7`. I need to change the format to use `=` instead of `: ` for the seq field.
