🦊 Selfware starting task...
Task: You are optimizing slow algorithms in the current directory.

The code has correct but extremely slow implementations. Performance tests are timing out.

Acceptance criteria:
1. two_sum must use O(n) HashMap lookup instead of O(n²) nested loops.
2. count_unique_words must use HashSet instead of Vec::contains().
3. longest_common_subsequence must use dynamic programming instead of exponential recursion.
4. sorted_unique must use sort + dedup instead of nested loop dedup.
5. char_frequencies must use HashMap instead of per-character iteration.
6. All correctness and performance tests must pass within time budgets.

Process:
- Run cargo test first to see timeouts.
- Rewrite each function with the optimal algorithm.
- Run cargo test to verify all pass within time limits.
