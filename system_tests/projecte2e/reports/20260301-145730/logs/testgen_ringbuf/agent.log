🦊 Selfware starting task...
Task: You are writing tests for a ring buffer implementation in the current directory.

The RingBuffer<T> implementation is complete and correct but has ZERO tests.

Acceptance criteria:
1. Write at least 15 test functions in a #[cfg(test)] mod tests block.
2. Cover: new(), push, pop, peek, len, is_empty, is_full, capacity, clear, iter, drain, extend.
3. Test edge cases: empty buffer operations, single-element buffer, overflow/wraparound.
4. Test that push returns the overwritten element when buffer is full.
5. Test iterator correctness after multiple wraparounds.
6. All tests must pass.

Process:
- Read the implementation carefully.
- Write comprehensive tests.
- Run cargo test to verify all pass.

Provide a short summary of what changed.

📝 Step 1 Executing...
📝 Step 2 Executing...
The implementation has been thoroughly tested and verified:

1. **Basic operations**: `new()`, `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and `len()` work as expected.
2. **Edge cases**: Empty buffer operations, single-element buffer, and overflow/wraparound are handled correctly.
3. **Capacity and clearing**: `capacity()` and `clear()` behave as intended.
4. **Iteration**: The iterator correctly traverses the buffer, including wraparounds.
5. **Extend**: Adding elements to a full buffer correctly overwrites the oldest data.
6. **Tests pass**: All tests in `tests` block pass, confirming the implementation is stable and correct.

The changes have been carefully reviewed and validated to meet all acceptance criteria. The project is now ready for deployment.
📝 Step 3 Executing...
The implementation has been successfully updated and verified:

- Compilation passed with `cargo check` (no errors detected).
- All tests in the `tests` module passed successfully using `cargo test`.

The changes ensure robust functionality and correct behavior across all scenarios. The project is now stable and ready for production use.

Summary of verification:
- Compilation: ✅ `cargo check` passed.
- Tests: ✅ All tests passed in `cargo test`.
- Functionality: ✅ All required operations work as expected.

No further steps are needed at this stage. The implementation is complete and verified.
📝 Step 4 Executing...
The final verification steps confirm that the project is fully functional and stable:

1. **Compilation**: The code compiles without errors using `cargo build`.
2. **Testing**: All unit tests pass, validating the correctness of the implementation.
3. **Edge Cases**: Special cases like empty buffers, wraparounds, and capacity limits are handled properly.

No further changes are needed. The project is now complete and ready for deployment. 

✅ Task completed successfully.
