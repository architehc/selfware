You are fixing security vulnerabilities in the current directory.

The crate contains 5 vulnerable functions and empty _secure counterparts.

Acceptance criteria:
1. Implement read_user_file_secure with path canonicalization and prefix validation.
2. Implement run_search_secure with input sanitization (no shell metacharacters).
3. Implement validate_redirect_secure that rejects protocol-relative URLs and external hosts.
4. Implement render_greeting_secure with proper HTML entity escaping.
5. Implement handle_error_secure that returns generic error messages without internal paths.
6. All tests must pass.

Process:
- Run cargo test first to see which tests fail.
- Implement each secure function.
- Run cargo test to verify all pass.
