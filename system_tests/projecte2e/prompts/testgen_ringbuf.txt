You are writing tests for a ring buffer implementation in the current directory.

The RingBuffer<T> implementation is complete and correct but has ZERO tests.

Acceptance criteria:
1. Write at least 15 test functions in a #[cfg(test)] mod tests block.
2. Cover: new(), push, pop, peek, len, is_empty, is_full, capacity, clear, iter, drain, extend.
3. Test edge cases: empty buffer operations, single-element buffer, overflow/wraparound.
4. Test that push returns the overwritten element when buffer is full.
5. Test iterator correctness after multiple wraparounds.
6. All tests must pass.

Process:
- Read the implementation carefully.
- Write comprehensive tests.
- Run cargo test to verify all pass.
