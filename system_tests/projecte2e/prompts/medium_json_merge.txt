You are working on a Rust crate in the current directory.

Task:
1. Run cargo test.
2. Fix merge_json so nested JSON objects are merged recursively.
3. Preserve expected replacement behavior for non-object patches.
4. Keep function signature unchanged.
5. Run cargo test again and finish only when green.

Then provide a brief summary of the fix.
