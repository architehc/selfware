You are fixing a scheduling utility crate in the current directory.

Acceptance criteria:
1. parse_duration supports s/m/h/d units.
2. parse_duration trims surrounding whitespace.
3. parse_duration rejects zero durations and invalid formats.
4. next_run_at must not panic on overflow (return None instead).
5. scheduler timing tests all pass.

Process:
- Run cargo test first.
- Make minimal, high-quality code changes.
- Run cargo test before finalizing.

Provide a short summary of what changed.
