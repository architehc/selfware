You are fixing a multi-module Rust event bus library in the current directory.
The crate has bugs spread across multiple source files: src/event.rs, src/subscriber.rs, and src/bus.rs.

Task:
1. Run cargo test to see failures.
2. Read all source files to understand the architecture.
3. Fix bugs in:
   - event.rs: Display formatting
   - subscriber.rs: topic filter matching
   - bus.rs: sequence assignment and publish counting
4. Keep all public struct/function signatures unchanged.
5. Do not add dependencies.
6. Run cargo test and cargo clippy before finishing.

Provide a summary of each bug and fix.
