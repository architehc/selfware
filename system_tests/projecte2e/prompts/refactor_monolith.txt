You are refactoring a monolithic key-value store in the current directory.

Everything is currently in a single lib.rs file. Split it into proper modules.

Acceptance criteria:
1. Create src/entry.rs with the Entry struct and its methods.
2. Create src/store.rs with the KvStore struct and core CRUD methods.
3. Create src/query.rs with the query/filter methods (find_by_tag, find_by_prefix, find_newer_than).
4. Create src/serialization.rs with to_json/from_json methods.
5. Update src/lib.rs to declare and re-export modules.
6. All 8 existing tests must remain passing.
7. Add at least 2 new integration tests that verify cross-module functionality.

Process:
- Run cargo test first to confirm baseline.
- Extract modules one at a time.
- Run cargo test after each extraction to verify nothing breaks.
- Add new tests last.
