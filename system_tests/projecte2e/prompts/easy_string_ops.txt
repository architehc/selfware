You are fixing a small Rust string utility library in the current directory.

Task:
1. Run cargo test to see which tests fail.
2. Fix all bugs in the implementation so every test passes.
3. Keep all public function signatures unchanged.
4. Do not add any dependencies.
5. Run cargo test before finishing to confirm green.

When done, summarize exactly what you changed.
