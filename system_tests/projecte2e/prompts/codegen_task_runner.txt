You are implementing a task management library from type signatures in the current directory.

The types and method signatures are defined. All method bodies are todo!().

Acceptance criteria:
1. Implement all 12 methods on TaskManager.
2. add() should assign auto-incrementing IDs starting from 1.
3. sorted_by_priority() returns Critical first, then High, Medium, Low.
4. to_json/from_json must roundtrip correctly via serde.
5. cleanup_completed removes tasks with Status::Completed and created_at < older_than.
6. All 14 tests must pass.

Process:
- Read the type definitions and test expectations carefully.
- Implement each method to satisfy the tests.
- Run cargo test to verify all pass.
