# Mega Project Workspace

This directory is the target project used for long-duration Selfware experiments.

Bootstrap command:

```bash
bash ../scripts/bootstrap_megaproject.sh
```

After bootstrap, the Rust workspace lives at:

- `project/mega-workspace`

Use the long-run harness to drive iterative development tasks against it.
